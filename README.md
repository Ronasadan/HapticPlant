## Project Description:

Hook
A synthetic (non)living plant that interacts with humans and attempts to form an emotional  bond and relationship through haptic and auditory responses.

Narrative
Humans have a tendency to empathize with the familiar. In the age of companion robots that urge us to re-familiarize with the notion of strange new artificial forms and entities how can we design an experience that allows us to reevaluate what we consider as “the familiar”?Can an artificially enhanced inanimate organism mimic anthropomorphic familiar physical behaviors and form a synthetic empathetic relationship with the interacting humans? 

Using haptic responses including touch and audiovisual sensations through retraction/expansion and vibrations, we attempt to rewire a natural organism to simulate the process of human socialization. Uncannily augmenting a plant with human behavioral features, our project aims to see if our familiarity with human traits can induce a sense of empathy and further help develop compassionate bonds with synthetically manipulated entities.

However, what is the cost of establishing empathy with an anthropomorphically designed synthetic (non)living organism and what are the consequences of these human-centered power dynamics? Either quickly or slowly, the running electrical currents will eventually kill the plant by stemming it from operating on its own homeostasis, a natural system the organism itself is “familiar” of. Without a proper balance and inclusive consideration towards (non)living entities, our humanly efforts to empathize with the unfamiliar have the potentials to eventually harm an otherwise self-sustaining system.What does this say about our perception and reaction towards the unfamiliar, the alien, the unidentified visitor? Do we need to modify ourselves to become more accustomed to defamiliarization or do we adjust our surroundings to become more familiar and cater to our expectations? How does this affect the way we socialize and build empathic relationships with each other?
